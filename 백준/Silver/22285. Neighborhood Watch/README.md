### 문제 설명

<p>Jennifer was nominated to be neighborhood watch captain and is now in charge of managing the watch for her street. </p>

<p>Jennifer's street consists of houses on only one side of the road. She has a plan of which houses will be a <em>neighborhood watch house</em> and wants to know how safe the plan is. A <em>walk</em> from one house to another house (not necessarily distinct) is considered <em>safe</em> if there is at least one house along the walk that is a neighborhood watch house. The <em>safety rating</em> of a plan is the number of walks that are safe on the street. Since a walk is either safe or not safe, when traveling in either direction, it is not counted twice in the safety rating.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure G.1: Sample input. One example of a safe walk is traveling from house $1$ to house $5$.</p>

<p>Tell Jennifer the safety rating of her plan.</p>

### 입력

<p>The next $K$ lines describe the neighborhood watch houses. Each of these lines contains a single integer $H$ ($1 \leq H \leq N$), which is the house number of a neighborhood watch house. The house numbers are given in strictly increasing order.</p>

### 출력
